Issue Summary:
Duration: June 10, 2023, 10:00 AM - June 10, 2023, 11:30 AM (PST)
Impact: Web service downtime; users experienced errors and inability to access the application; 100% of the users were affected.

Root Cause: Incompatibility between the uploaded code and the outdated database server version.

Timeline:

10:00 AM: Issue detected when users started reporting errors and inability to access the web application.
10:05 AM: Monitoring system alerted the team about increased error rates and server response times.
10:10 AM: The team investigated the load balancer logs and noticed a spike in 500 server errors.
10:15 AM: Assumed the issue might be related to the code deployment and began investigating the recently uploaded code.
10:25 AM: Observed that the code had additional dependencies that required a recent version of the database server.
10:30 AM: Initially suspected a misconfiguration in the code deployment process and verified all configuration files.
10:40 AM: Realized that the database server version was outdated and incompatible with the dependencies in the code.
10:45 AM: Incident escalated to the database administration team for further investigation and assistance.
11:00 AM: The database administration team confirmed the incompatibility issue and recommended upgrading the server.
11:15 AM: The web development team applied a patch to make the code compatible with the older database server version.
11:30 AM: The code deployment was successful, and the web service was restored.
Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the web stack outage was the incompatibility between the uploaded code and the outdated version of the database server. The code required certain dependencies that were not supported by the older server version. As a result, the server encountered errors while trying to execute the code, leading to service downtime.

To resolve the issue, the database administration team recommended upgrading the server to a compatible version. However, due to limited resources and immediate restoration requirements, the web development team decided to apply a patch to modify the code and make it compatible with the older server version. This temporary fix allowed the application to function properly without upgrading the server.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent similar incidents in the future, the following measures will be implemented:

Regular System Updates: Establish a scheduled system update process to keep all servers, including the database server, up to date with the latest versions and patches.

Compatibility Testing: Implement a comprehensive compatibility testing process for all code deployments to ensure compatibility with the existing server infrastructure.

Documentation and Communication: Improve documentation and communication channels between teams to ensure that the dependencies and requirements of code deployments are clearly communicated and understood.

Tasks to Address the Issue:

Upgrade Database Server: Schedule and perform an upgrade of the database server to a compatible version, ensuring minimal disruption to the web service.

Dependency Management: Implement a robust dependency management system to handle code dependencies efficiently and avoid compatibility issues.

Automated Monitoring: Enhance the monitoring system to provide real-time alerts and notifications for critical errors, allowing prompt identification and resolution of issues.

Testing Environment: Set up a dedicated testing environment that mirrors the production environment, enabling thorough compatibility testing before code deployments.

By implementing these measures and addressing the tasks mentioned above, we aim to prevent similar compatibility-related outages in the future and ensure a more stable and reliable web service for our users.
